# Orbital
Orbital is a realtime 3D/2D animation of a space station orbiting a planet.  The source file, "orbital.qtz.zip" requires MacOS with Xcode installed.  The stand-alone application will only run on MacOS.

If you choose to compile from source using Xcode be sure to unzip "orbital.qtz.zip."  This file was compressed to fall under the 25MB upload limit.  There's a high chance that your build will fail but go for it.  This code is from 2010 and although it compiled without error then-hence the precompiled application -it has not been maintained since then.  Making an application from the source starting from scratch is not very challenging so have at it.
