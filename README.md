# Orbital
Orbital is a realtime 3D/2D simulation of a space station orbiting a planet.  The source file, "orbital.qtz.zip" requires MacOS with Xcode installed.  The stand-alone application will only run on MacOS.

If you choose to compile from source using Xcode be sure to unzip "orbital.qtz.zip."  This file was compressed to fall under the 25MB upload limit.  There's a high chance that your build will fail but go for it.  This code is from 2010 and although it compiled without error then-hence the precompiled application -it has not be maintained since then.
